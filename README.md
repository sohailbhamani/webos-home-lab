# webOS Home Screen Lab

Reclaim the home screen on an LG webOS 6.x or 7.x TV you own: drop the ads, promos,
"Start a new experience" filler and unused tiles, put a full-screen photo
behind everything, and make the input tiles dark so they sit on it.

This is a customization guide for a TV you own. It has no exploit code. Rooting
is done with the public community tools linked in
[`docs/01-rooting.md`](docs/01-rooting.md), and everything in this repo runs
after the TV is already rooted.

## Tested TVs

| Model | Year / webOS | Firmware | RAM | UI resolution | Patch set | Notes |
|-------|--------------|----------|-----|---------------|-----------|-------|
| 43UP8000PUR | 2021 / webOS 6.5 | 03.51.16 | 1 GB | Not measured. The background is made at 1920x1080 and goes in `images/2k` and `images/4k` | `patches/` | The original set. Screenshots through the VNC Server app |
| 43UQ7070ZUD | 2022 / webOS 7.6 (webOS 22) | 04.60.90 | 1.3 GB | 1920x1080 on a 4K panel, so images load from `images/2k` | `patches/webos7/` | Stock home adds a "TV functions" shelf, which `01` removes. `05` also hides the "See User Guide" tile. Screenshots with the capture service need `SCREEN`, since `DISPLAY` comes back black. See [`docs/06-webos7.md`](docs/06-webos7.md) |

Other models use the same home app structure, but file names and image sizes
vary, so read your own files instead of pasting mine.

## The shape of it

LG's home screen is a QML app on a signed, read-only partition. You can't edit
it in place, but you can bind-mount a writable copy over it and force the app to
relaunch from your copy. A boot hook re-applies the mount on every power-on.
That's the whole mechanism. The rest is reading LG's QML and changing the right
lines.

[`docs/02-how-the-home-app-works.md`](docs/02-how-the-home-app-works.md) covers
the one real gotcha: webOS restores the home app from a frozen memory
checkpoint, so you have to delete the checkpoint or your edits stay invisible.

## Quick start (TV already rooted, SSH reachable)

```sh
# 1. Copy LG's stock home QML off the TV to ./stock-qml, then:
cd stock-qml
git init -q && git add -A && git commit -qm stock      # baseline to diff against
git apply ../patches/*.patch                            # webOS 6.x; on webOS 7 use ../patches/webos7/*.patch

# 2. Render the background. The rotation/crop are tuned for the 3840x1920 ESO
#    Milky Way panorama; for another photo, adjust the constants at the top.
python3 ../scripts/render_home_bg.py my_photo.jpg bg_space_SIZE.jpg
cp bg_space_1920.jpg UserInterfaceLayer/Components/images/2k/bg_space.jpg
cp bg_space_1920.jpg UserInterfaceLayer/Components/images/4k/bg_space.jpg

# 3. Push the copy to the TV and apply (see scripts/deploy.sh for the real thing)
```

Apply the patches one at a time and look at the screen after each. Match LG's
exact image dimensions, keep assets small (these TVs have 1 to 1.3 GB of RAM and
thrash on oversized images), and always keep LG's original QML so you can roll back.

## Safety / scope

- This modifies your own TV's UI. Nothing here targets anyone else's device.
- Keep a backup of the stock QML and your boot hooks. A bad QML edit black-screens
  the home app, and restoring the backup and relaunching fixes it.
- Don't let the TV auto-update. The public rooting tools include an update
  blocker for exactly this reason.
